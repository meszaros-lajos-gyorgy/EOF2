# EOF2

Event Oriented Factory v2 - A php framework

### What is this project?

This project is aimed to create a more strongly typed PHP framework with a taste of Java like classes and ideas.
This framework also aims to create classes, that have a consistent and chainable set of methods, while extend base functionality with the missing features of PHP.

The first version of this framework only focused on introducing event oriented code, but it was discontinued, because the current [PHP functions are sometimes so inconsistent](http://phpsadness.com/), that creating a rock solid base should be the priority. I mean, just look at the string functions.
Also, another goal was to make types more important, since PHP is very loose with that, which can make debugging harder.

For this current project, I took some ideas from the Java language, while also experimented with the new SPL libraries.

### Planned future features

Multithreading
Socket support

### Requirements:

PHP 5.4+
Headers, Deflate, Filter and Rewrite Apache modules
